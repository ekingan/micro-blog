I was inspired by this assignment to try to recreate a game traditionally played on paper. 
The original game requires players to write a story together, without seeing the entire content of the story.
The first player writes a sentance, then passes the paper to the next player. The next player
then writes a second sentance and then folds the paper in such a way that the third player can only
see the sentance written by the player directly before her. The game continues this way until the 
paper is totally filled up and then the story is read in its entirety.
The story is often really funny when you read it.

For this project the user is invited to tell a story, one line at a time. Once a post is published, a comment
box appears below the posting. The comment box could be used to elaborate, or if could be used for a second 
player to add to what was written before her. The result could be a stream of conciousness, a story, poety, 
or political banter. I used a background image that I took in Michigan a couple years ago on a run.
I used a bootstrap theme that I felt complimented the color scheme of the photo.
Thanks for reading.
